The app allows users to create food and activity entries by adding a name and calorie value. A summary section displays total calories consumed, burned, and the net difference.

Created as part of a course, this project helped strengthen my understanding of Flexbox for structuring web pages. While the interface visually mimics Spotify, it is not dynamic or responsive, and buttons are non-functional. This project served as a valuable exercise in mastering CSS layout techniques.",
